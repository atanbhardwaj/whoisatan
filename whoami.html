                    <p>I love the arts. I always participated in skits, drama. I like acting. It is so much fun. Mostly,
                        I got chances to participate in school whenever there was some special occasion such as
                        Christmas, Independence Day, Teacher's Day, etc. We got the last and the second last period free
                        for us at time table to prepare for the play. These participations were such an exhilarating
                        thing for me. I enjoyed them with all of my heart.
                    <p>
                    <p>Let me discuss the pictures now.
                    <p>
                    <p>The first picture is from the <span class="skits">Christman Skit: Birth of Jesus.</span> I got to
                        play Jesus's disciple/brother. That was interesting, to be honest. It went well. You can see me
                        first from the right. </p>
                    <p>The second and third picture is from <span class="skits">Republic day.</span> That was just an
                        inter-house dance competition. I was in St. Paul's House. That house had the lead legacy in art
                        competitions. So, we always had more number of win celebrations. In second picture you may find
                        me second from left. And in the third, first from right.</p>
                    <p>The last picture is of me singing. I really don't remember what. But, yeah I uploaded this one
                        too. Because I like to sing. </p>

                        There are so many things I enjoy doing. I'll start by talking about programming. Yeah! so,
                        programming has now become one of those things for me that I find my days just go passing by the
                        window. I really enjoy it. I also, love doing mathematics and physics and having general talks
                        on these natural sciences. Talking about the scientists and physicists whose work made this
                        world take a giant leap forward in time. These things are a real fascination for me.</p>
                    <p>You can see
                        my serious face in the first picture above which is nothing more than a sign that I was involved
                        truly in what I was studying. My sister took that picture.</p>
                    <p>The second picture is, about me
                        when
                        I was lending a helping hand to my cousins in their mathematics project work. </p>
                    <p>And the third
                        one
                        is about me sleeping in my college library. Impressive, right?</p>
                    <p>
                        The fourth one is me eating samosa in my hostel's mess. I think that's from the first year of
                        college. That was the unique year in itself.

                <p>Here you may see a few pictures clicked by me. I clicked these photos with my phone's camera. I
                    believe every object can describe its living state, I mean to say personification through the
                    lens and hence the object gets independent of the life factor, just the definition of what it is
                    in that frame of time. Just as whole as it can be. I'm a beginner right now. But, I'll explore
                    this with time.</p>
                <p> I'll describe the images now, so, the first click is of the candle which was
                    placed on my computer table and there was a power cut off in my house. I clicked the image and
                    named it as flame and used a poem by Linkin Park for it and later posted it onto my Instagram
                    handle. </p>
                <p>The second image is of the moon which I clicked on 8<sup>th</sup> April 2020. I was
                    inspired by one
                    of my friends to click this one. Posted this one too on my Instagram handle. </p>
                <p>The last two
                    images
                    are a little abstract nature type. You may give them the meaning that comes to your mind.</p>
                <p> I'll
                    keep exploring
                    this field... and keep updating this feed.  </p>

                    <h1 class="computers">Computers</h1>
                    <p>
                        I was always smitten with these machines: the computers from when I was little, I saw those
                        512MB RAM computers, played around with them. Although, I did not have my own until
                        8<sup>th</sup> grade.
                        But, those computers in the year 2002 - 2007 I guess. They had this huge body and seemed so
                        attractive. I wanted to just play with them, my curiosity started to grow and since, at that
                        time, my only option was to visit my Nani's house and that happened only when I used to get my
                        summer vacations. My uncle would allow me to try my hands on the machine but it was only for a
                        very short time.
                        Nevertheless, I learned most just by looking at how they used it. Sometimes, they also did the
                        hardware stuff too. So, from there I learned about the hardware components such as the
                        motherboard, Hard Drive, Memory, CPU, etc. But, It never came to my mind that I would learn
                        about computers this way, the way that I have started to learn about them right now. And yeah,
                        now I want to use these machines in a way which would bring about a positive change in society.
                        Contribution is my goal as of now. That's just a brief of how I was introduced to computers in
                        my life.
