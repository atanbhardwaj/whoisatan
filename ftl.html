                    Is this facet about our brain?
                </h1>

                <h1 id="basicftl">Back to Basics</h1>
                <p><span class="brainh">NEUROGENESIS:</span> Every day the brain generates 10,000 stem cells that
                    split into two. One becomes a daughter line that continues making stem cells, and the other migrates
                    to wherever it’s needed in the brain and becomes that kind of cell. Very often that destination is
                    where the cell is needed for new learning. Over the next four months, that new cell forms about
                    10,000 connections with others to create new neural circuitry.</p>
                <p>Neurogenesis adds power to our understanding of neuroplasticity, that the
                    brain continually reshapes itself according to the experiences we have. If we are learning a new
                    golf swing, that circuitry will attract connections and neurons. If we are changing a habit – say
                    trying to get better at listening – then that circuitry will grow accordingly.</p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, when we try to overcome a bad habit, we’re up against the thickness of the
                    circuitry for something we’ve practiced and repeated thousands of times. So what are the brain
                    lessons for coaching, or for working on our own to enhance an emotional intelligence skill?
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, get committed. Mobilize the motivating power in the left prefrontal areas. If you’re a coach,
                    you’ve got to engage the person, get them enthused about achieving the goal of change. Here it helps
                    to draw on their dreams, their vision for themselves, where they want to be in the future. Then work
                    from where they are now on what they might improve to help them get where they want to go in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step is to get very practical: Don’t take on trying to learn too much all at once.
                    Operationalize your goal at the level of a specific behavior. Make it practical, so you know exactly
                    what to do and when. For example, say someone has “Blackberry syndrome”: a bad habit of
                    multi-tasking and essentially ignoring others, which undermines the full attention that can lead to
                    rapport and good chemistry. You have to break the habit of multi-tasking. So the person might make
                    up an intentional learning plan that says something like: at every naturally occurring opportunity –
                    when a person walks into your office, say, or you come up to a person – you turn off your cell phone
                    and your beeper, turn away from your computer, turn off your daydream or your preoccupation and pay
                    full attention. That gives you a precise piece of behavior to try to change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what will help with that? Noticing when a moment like that is about to come, and doing the right
                    thing. Doing the wrong thing is a habit that you have become an Olympic level master at – your
                    neural wiring has made it a default option, what you do automatically. The neural connectivity for
                    that is strong. When you start to form the new, better habit you are essentially creating new
                    circuitry that competes with your old habit in a kind of neural Darwinism. To make the new habit
                    strong enough, you’re got to use the power of neuroplasticity – you have to do it over and over
                    again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you persist in the better habit, that new circuitry will connect and become more and more
                    powerful, until one day you'll do the right thing in the right way without a second thought. That
                    means the circuitry has become so connected and thick that this is the brain’s new default option.
                    With that change in the brain, the better habit will become your automatic choice.
                    For how long and how many times does an action have to be repeated until it’s actually hard-wired? A
                    habit begins to be hard-wired the very first time you practice it. The more you practice it, the
                    more connectivity. How often you have to repeat it so that it becomes the new default of the brain
                    depends in part on how strong the old habit is that it will replace. It usually takes three to six
                    months of using all naturally occurring practice opportunities before the new habit comes more
                    naturally than the old.
